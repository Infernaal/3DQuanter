    <strong>To protect against known severe issues with certain versions of third party plugins</strong>, 3D Quanter supports
    the use of a centralized plugin version blacklist to automatically disable such plugins before they can interfere
    with normal operation.

<p>{% trans url="https://plugins.octoprint.org/blacklist/" %}
    By default, 3D Quanter will use the blacklist hosted at <code>plugins.octoprint.org/blacklist.json</code> which you
    can also take a look at in a more human readable format <a href="{{ url }}" target="_blank">here</a>.
