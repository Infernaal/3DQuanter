    <strong>To protect against known severe issues with certain versions of third party plugins</strong>, 3D Quanter supports
    the use of a centralized plugin version blacklist to automatically disable such plugins before they can interfere
    with normal operation.

    By default, 3D Quanter will use the blacklist hosted at <code>plugins.3dquanter.org/blacklist.json</code>.
